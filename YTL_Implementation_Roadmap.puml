  Month 6: Full Annual Benefit Achieved

  **RESOURCE ALLOCATION:**
  - SI Consultants: 40-50 FTE weeks
  - Client Resources: 20-30 FTE weeks
  - Testing Team: 15-20 FTE weeks

  **RISK MITIGATION:**
  - Phased go-live (plant before marketing)
  - MVP modules reduce custom code risk
  - Extensive testing (UT + SIT + UAT)
  - Hypercare support for 1 month
