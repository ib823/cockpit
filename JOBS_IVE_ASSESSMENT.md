> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

**Date:** November 14, 2025
**Subject:** Complete UI/UX overhaul for `/architecture/v3`.

## The Verdict: Unacceptable in Present Form

I have reviewed the product, the codebase, and the mountain of documentation.

**The engineering is competent. The user experience is a catastrophic failure.**

The application is built for the 1% of users who are already TOGAF-certified enterprise architects. It completely fails the other 99%: the product managers, the executives, the business analysts who simply want to visualize a technology transformation.

It is overwrought with jargon, plagued by archaic UI patterns, and lacks the fundamental principles of intuitive design. It has the bones of a powerful tool but no soul.

**Current Grade: C-**
**Potential Grade: A+**

This document is the roadmap to bridge that gap. It is not a list of suggestions; it is a plan of action.

## Part 1: The Unforgivable Sins (The "P0" Issues)

These are not bugs; they are insults to the user. They are to be fixed immediately.

### 1. The `window.prompt()` Dialog

**Location:** `ProposedSolutionTab.tsx`
**Crime:** Using a 1997-era browser dialog for template selection. It looks broken, feels cheap, and screams "prototype."
**Steve's Reaction:** *"Fire the person who approved this."*

**The Fix:**
- A full-screen modal, the `TemplateLibrary`.
- It will feature a visual gallery of available templates.
- Each template will have a name, a description, and a thumbnail preview of the diagram.
- One-click application. No more typing numbers into a tiny box.

### 2. The Wall of Forms

**Location:** `BusinessContextTab.tsx`
**Crime:** Greeting the user with nine multi-line text areas on the very first screen. It's an interrogation.
**Jony's Assessment:** *"We are asking for a novel when we should be asking for a headline. This creates instant fatigue and guarantees user abandonment."*

**The Fix (Progressive Disclosure):**
- The tab will initially show only **three** essential fields:
    1.  `Project Name` (Input)
    2.  `What problem are you solving?` (Textarea, 2 rows)
    3.  `Target Completion Date` (Date Picker)
- The other six fields will be collapsed under an accordion labeled `+ Add more details (optional)`.
- Respect the user's time. Earn their engagement.

### 3. Invisible Interaction Modes

**Location:** `ProposedSolutionTab.tsx` (Integration Drawing)
**Crime:** The user is expected to click two components to create an integration with zero visual feedback that they have entered a special "drawing mode."
**Steve's Reaction:** *"How are they supposed to know? Are they psychic? Did we ship a crystal ball with the software?"*

**The Fix:**
- When the user initiates drawing:
    1.  A dismissible alert appears at the top: `Drawing Integration: Select the first component. (Press ESC to cancel)`.
    2.  The cursor changes to a `crosshair`.
    3.  When the first component is clicked, it gets a thick, pulsating blue outline. The alert updates: `Connect to [Component Name]: Select the second component.`.
    4.  Hovering over other components shows a preview of the connecting line.
- The mode must be obvious, and the escape hatch (`ESC` key) must be immediate.

### 4. Jargon & Confusing Labels

**Location:** Everywhere
**Crime:** Using insider terminology like "TO-BE," "AS-IS," and "Proposed Solution."
**Jony's Assessment:** *"We should use the language of humans, not the language of frameworks. The interface should feel like a conversation with a smart colleague, not like reading a technical manual."*

**The Fix:**
- **"Business Context"** → **"1. The Why"** (Or "Scope & Goals")
- **"Current Landscape"** → **"2. Where We Are Today (AS-IS)"**
- **"Proposed Solution"** → **"3. Where We're Going (TO-BE)"**
- The terms "AS-IS" and "TO-BE" can be used as sub-labels for clarity, but they should not be the primary navigation.

### 5. The Ghost Tab

**Location:** `Process Mapping` Tab
**Crime:** Shipping a tab that does nothing. It's a broken promise.
**Steve's Reaction:** *"If it's not ready, it doesn't exist. Remove it. It erodes trust and makes the entire product feel unfinished."*

**The Fix:**
- The `Process Mapping` tab will be removed from the UI immediately. It can live in a feature branch until it is functional.

## Part 2: The Path to an 'A' Product (The Redesign)

This is how we transform the experience from a chore into a delight.

### 1. A Real-Time, Living Diagram

**The Problem:** The diagram is an afterthought, generated by a button at the bottom of the page.
**The Vision:** The diagram is the centerpiece.

**The Fix:**
- A two-panel layout. The left 2/3 of the screen is the input area (the tabs). The right 1/3 is the **live diagram preview**.
- As the user adds a system in the "Current State" tab, it appears instantly in the diagram.
- As they define a phase in the "Future Vision" tab, the diagram animates to show the new state.
- The "Generate Diagram" button is deleted. The diagram is always present, always up-to-date. It is the canvas, not the output.

### 2. A Visual Timeline for Phases

**The Problem:** Phases are abstract concepts hidden in dropdowns.
**The Vision:** Phases are tangible steps on a journey.

**The Fix:**
- In the "Future Vision" tab, replace the phase list with a horizontal timeline component.
- It will look like this:
  `TODAY -----● Phase 1 (6 mos) -----● Phase 2 (12 mos) -----● FUTURE`
- Users can drag the phase markers to adjust duration. They can click a phase on the timeline to see and edit the components within it.
- This makes the concept of a "phased migration" instantly understandable.

### 3. An Interactive Onboarding Tour

**The Problem:** The user is dropped into a complex tool with zero guidance.
**The Vision:** The user understands the core value proposition in 60 seconds.

**The Fix:**
- On first visit, a skippable, interactive tour will launch.
- **Step 1:** "Welcome. Let's visualize your technology transformation in 3 steps."
- **Step 2 (Highlights Tab 2):** "First, tell us what you have today (your AS-IS)."
- **Step 3 (Highlights Tab 3):** "Next, design what you want tomorrow (your TO-BE)."
- **Step 4 (Highlights Timeline):** "Plan how you'll get there in phases."
- **Step 5:** "You're ready. Let's begin."
- This is not a video; it's the actual UI, dimmed, with spotlights and tooltips guiding the user.

### 4. Intelligent Automation

**The Problem:** The tool makes the user do all the work.
**The Vision:** The tool anticipates the user's needs.

**The Fix:**
- **Smart Reuse:** When a user adds a component to the "Future Vision" and sets its status to "Reused," a modal will appear. This modal will show a list of all components from the "Current State." The user clicks one, and all details are automatically populated. The machine connects the dots.
- **Status Legend:** A small `(?)` icon next to the "Status" dropdown (NEW, REUSED, RETIRED) will open a popover explaining what each status means with a visual example. No more guessing.

## Part 3: The Refactoring Imperative

The codebase itself, while functional, contains several "monolith" components that are difficult to maintain and impossible to test effectively.

- `BusinessContextTab.tsx` (1273 lines)
- `ProposedSolutionTab.tsx` (1093 lines)
- `GanttCanvasV3.tsx` (1705 lines)

**The Mandate:**
- As we implement the UX changes, we will simultaneously refactor these components.
- Each of these files will be broken down into smaller, single-purpose components, none exceeding 250 lines.
- We will introduce custom hooks (`useBusinessContext`, `useProposedSolution`) to encapsulate state logic and keep components clean.
- All inline styles will be migrated to CSS classes that reference our design tokens (`--accent`, `--shadow-md`, etc.).

This is not optional. This is about building a foundation that can be iterated upon for years to come. It is about craftsmanship.

## The 4-Week Roadmap

- **Week 1: Triage & P0 Fixes.** Implement all fixes from "Part 1: The Unforgivable Sins." The product must be usable and respectable by the end of this week.
- **Week 2: The Core Revolution.** Implement the real-time diagram panel and the visual phase timeline. This is the heart of the new experience.
- **Week 3: Delight & Onboarding.** Build the interactive tour. Implement smart reuse and other automation.
- **Week 4: Refactor & Polish.** Aggressively refactor the monolith components. Hunt down and fix every minor UI inconsistency, animation timing, and alignment issue.

## Final Word

You have a choice. You can continue to patch and document a flawed experience, or you can commit to a revolution.

This plan is the revolution. It requires courage, focus, and a ruthless dedication to the user's experience. It is the path to a product that is not just functional, but delightful. A product that feels like it was designed by people who care.

This is the Apple way. This is our way.

**Now, we execute.**
