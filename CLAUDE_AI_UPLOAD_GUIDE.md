## 📤 Upload to Claude.ai

### Step 1: Create a New Project
1. Go to https://claude.ai
2. Click "Projects" in sidebar
3. Click "+ New Project"
4. Name it: **"SAP Cockpit Assessment"**

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Click "Add content" → "Upload files"
2. **Drag and drop** `claude-assessment.zip`
3. Wait for extraction (Claude.ai auto-extracts zips)

### Step 3: Ask Claude to Assess

Paste this prompt:

```
Read CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md first for context.

Then perform a comprehensive assessment of this SAP Implementation Cockpit:

1. **Architecture Review**
   - Design patterns used (good/bad)
   - Separation of concerns
   - Code organization issues

2. **Security Audit**
   - Beyond existing protections (WebAuthn, RBAC, sanitization)
   - Potential vulnerabilities in business logic
   - Data validation gaps

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Bottlenecks in scenario generation (scenario-generator.ts)
   - State management inefficiencies
   - Opportunities for optimization

4. **Type Safety**
   - Problematic 'any' usage (currently 140 instances)
   - Missing type guards
   - Union type improvements

5. **Code Quality**
   - Complex functions that should be split
   - Duplicate code
   - Naming inconsistencies

6. **Testing Gaps**
   - Critical paths without tests
   - Integration test opportunities
   - Edge cases not covered

7. **Database Schema**
   - Optimization opportunities (indexes, relations)
   - Migration concerns
   - Query performance

8. **Production Readiness**
   - Blocking issues for deployment
   - Performance concerns at scale
   - Monitoring/observability gaps

Prioritize findings: CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
Provide specific file:line references where possible.
