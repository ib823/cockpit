## 5. Baseline Facts to Preserve
1. Strict lint/typecheck currently fail at high volume.
2. Middleware auth logic previously showed high-risk public-path pattern.
3. Debug/admin endpoint exposure review is mandatory before production claim.
4. UI/UX system is fragmented and needs consolidation.

## 6. Open Blockers
1. None recorded in this initialization pass.

## 7. Next Mandatory Actions
1. Complete repo cleanup/deletion pass and finalize canonical doc set.
2. Finalize and verify strict proprietary license.
3. Start Phase 0 security tasks (A-01 then A-03).

## 8. Session Log
