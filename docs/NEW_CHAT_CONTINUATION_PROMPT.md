CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES

Production-ready code only - no pseudocode
Exact terminal commands - user copy-pastes directly
Be brutally honest about what works/doesn't work
Repository runs in user's Codespace - not your environment

Remember: Drag & drop is COMPLETE and working perfectly. Focus on next features.
