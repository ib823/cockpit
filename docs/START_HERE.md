## 🎯 Design Principles Applied

### 1. Focus
- One primary action per screen
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Minimal cognitive load

### 2. Simplicity
- Mode-specific layouts (not generic)
- Progressive disclosure (slide-overs)
- Remove unnecessary elements

### 3. Delight
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Beautiful empty states
- Satisfying interactions

### 4. Integration
- Everything works seamlessly
- Consistent design language
- Cohesive user experience

---

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

### Global (All Modes)
- `Tab` - Navigate between elements
- `Enter` - Activate button/selection
- `ESC` - Close modal/slide-over

### Present Mode Only
- `←` - Previous slide
- `→` - Next slide
- `ESC` - Exit to Plan mode
- `Click dots` - Jump to specific slide

---

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Mode not displaying correctly
**Fix:** Check browser console for errors. Verify all store hooks are working.

### Issue: Animations feel janky
**Fix:** Check FPS in Chrome DevTools. Should be 60fps consistently.

### Issue: Present mode shows costs
**Fix:** Verify you're using PresentMode.tsx (not PlanMode). Costs should never appear in Present mode.

### Issue: Keyboard shortcuts not working
**Fix:** Click inside the app to focus it, then try shortcuts again.

### More Issues?
Check [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting.

### Measuring Impact
Track these metrics:

- Present mode usage (should be >50%)
- User satisfaction (should be 9+/10)
